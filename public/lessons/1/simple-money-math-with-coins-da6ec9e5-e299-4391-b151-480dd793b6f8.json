Let's count together!\"\n4. **Add values**: Use the values: pennies = 1 cent, nickels = 5 cents, dimes = 10 cents, quarters = 25 cents. Ask: \"If we have 3 dimes, how much money is that? Let's add it up!\"\n5. **Create combinations**: Challenge your child to make different amounts using the coins. Say: \"Can you make 30 cents using these coins?\"",
