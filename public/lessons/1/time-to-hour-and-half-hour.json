It's pointing to 3, so it's 3 o'clock.\n3. **Say:** The long hand is the minute hand. When it points to 12, it's the start of an hour.  \n**Show/Do:** Point the minute hand to 12.  \n**Ask:** What time is it if the hour hand is on 4 and the minute hand is on 12?  \n**Reinforce:** That's right, it's 4 o'clock!\n4. **Say:** Now, let's learn about half-hour. When the minute hand points to 6, it's half past the hour.  \n**Show/Do:** Move the minute hand to 6.  \n**Ask:** If the hour hand is between 4 and 5, and the minute hand is on 6, what time is it?  \n**Reinforce:** Yes, it's 4:30, or half past 4!\n5. **Say:** Let's practice setting the clock to different times together.  \n**Show/Do:** Encourage your child to move the hands to specific times you suggest.  \n**Ask:** Can you show me 2 o'clock? How about 5:30?  \n**Reinforce:** You're doing great! Keep practicing, and you'll be a time-telling expert.\n\n## Practice Questions (Do It Together)\n**1.
