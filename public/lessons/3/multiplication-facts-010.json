Encourage the use of multiplication tables for reference.\n\n## 👨‍👩‍👧 Parent Teaching Script (Step-by-Step Conversation)\n1. **Say:** Let's explore multiplication together. It's like adding the same number over and over.  \n**Show/Do:** Show them an array of 3 rows with 4 objects in each row.  \n**Ask:** How many objects are there in total?  \n**Reinforce:** Great! That's 3 groups of 4, which is 12. This is called multiplication.\n2. **Say:** Multiplying by 0 always gives us 0. Let's see why.  \n**Show/Do:** Show 0 groups of 5 objects.  \n**Ask:** How many objects do we have now?  \n**Reinforce:** Exactly, 0! Multiplying by 0 always results in 0.\n3. **Say:** Multiplying by 1 gives us the same number. Let's try it.  \n**Show/Do:** Show 1 group of 6 objects.  \n**Ask:** How many objects are there?  \n**Reinforce:** Right, it's still 6. Multiplying by 1 doesn't change the number.\n4. **Say:** Let's practice with number 2. Can you see the pattern?  \n**Show/Do:** Show 2 groups of 3 objects.  \n**Ask:** How many objects do we have now?  \n**Reinforce:** Correct! 2 times 3 is 6. It's like adding 3 twice.\n5. **Say:** Let's try a bigger number, like 5.  \n**Show/Do:** Show 5 groups of 2 objects.  \n**Ask:** How many objects in total?  \n**Reinforce:** Awesome! 5 times 2 is 10.\n\n## Practice Questions (Do It Together)\n**1.
