Practice converting fractions to decimals and vice versa.\n\n## 👨‍👩‍👧 Parent Teaching Script (Step-by-Step Conversation)\n1. **Say:** Let's talk about decimals. They're like fractions, but written differently.  \n**Show/Do:** Show a pie chart divided into 10 equal parts.  \n**Ask:** How many parts make up the whole pie?  \n**Reinforce:** Right, 10 parts make a whole! Each part is one-tenth of the pie.\n2. **Say:** Now, let's look at hundredths.  \n**Show/Do:** Use graph paper to show a 10x10 grid.  \n**Ask:** How many squares are there in total?  \n**Reinforce:** Exactly, 100 squares! Each tiny square is one-hundredth.\n3. **Say:** Decimals are like fractions, but they are written with a dot, called a decimal point.  \n**Show/Do:** Write 0.1 and 0.01 on paper.  \n**Ask:** Which one is bigger, 0.1 or 0.01?  \n**Reinforce:** Great! 0.1 is bigger because it's one-tenth, while 0.01 is one-hundredth.\n4. **Say:** Let's connect this to money. Imagine you have $1.00.  \n**Show/Do:** Show a dollar bill and a penny.  \n**Ask:** How many cents are in one dollar?  \n**Reinforce:** Yes, 100 cents! So, $1.00 is like 100 hundredths or 1 whole.\n5. **Say:** Decimals help us in many ways, like measuring ingredients when cooking.  \n**Show/Do:** Measure out 0.5 cups of flour.  \n**Ask:** How much of a cup is this?  \n**Reinforce:** That's half a cup, or 5 tenths of a cup!\n\n## Practice Questions (Do It Together)\n**1.
