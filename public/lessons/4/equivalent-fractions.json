Imagine it's a pizza.  \n**Show/Do:** Draw a circle and shade half of it.  \n**Ask:** What if we cut the same pizza into 4 slices instead of 2? How many slices would we need to shade to keep the same amount?  \n**Reinforce:** Exactly, 2/4 is the same as 1/2. They cover the same amount of space.\n2. **Say:** Now, let's use numbers to find equivalent fractions.  \n**Show/Do:** Write 1/2 and multiply both the top and bottom by 2.  \n**Ask:** What do we get when we do that?  \n**Reinforce:** That's right, 2/4! It's the same as 1/2.\n3. **Say:** Let's try another one. How about 3/5?  \n**Show/Do:** Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2.  \n**Ask:** What fraction do we get?  \n**Reinforce:** Yes, 6/10 is equivalent to 3/5.\n4. **Say:** Can you think of a fraction that is equivalent to 2/3?  \n**Show/Do:** Try multiplying both parts by 3.  \n**Ask:** What do you find?  \n**Reinforce:** 8/12 is equivalent to 2/3. Well done!\n5. **Say:** Remember, as long as we multiply (or divide) the numerator and denominator by the same number, the fractions are equivalent.  \n**Show/Do:** Summarize with a few more examples.  \n**Ask:** Can you spot any patterns?  \n**Reinforce:** Great job!
